# How to get along AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals

## What is part of the Certification
The certification is described in detail at the offical [certification page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900). Take a closer look at the [Download Exam Skills](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3VwUY) area as the detailed topics as well as their contribution to the overall amount of questions in the exam. 
Be aware that this is not a techie certification, but gives a broad overview on Microsoft Azure and the cloud. There will aslo be some specific questions on Azure services, so memorize their description. No need to know the services in detail.

## Learning Ressources
There are a lot of learning ressources available. A good starting point is the Microsoft Azure [Learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/) that is for free.

There is also a nice offical book for the certification: [Exam Ref AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals ](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07ST3HKMJ/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_pSWaFb6QK78BY).

I would also highly recommend tomake some dry runs with questions on the exam. There are some free resources available (just google for them), but I would recommend the offering of [Whizlabs](https://www.whizlabs.com/microsoft-azure-certification-az-900/). 

I do not think that an online course like Udemy is necessary for this certification.

## Types of questions
The following types of questions occur are:
* Multiple Choice
* Fill in the gaps
* Match pairs

The AZ-900 does not have any code questions included, so no coding skills required. 

## Criteria for passing the exam
The exam is passed when you achieve more than 700 points. However you do not see any points during the exam, so just try to provide as many right answers as possible :-)

## Feedback
After the exam you can give feedback to the questions e. g. if they are unclear. Use that opportunity.
